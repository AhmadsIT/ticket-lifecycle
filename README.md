<h1>osTicket - Ticket Lifecycle Example Setup</h1>
<p>This tutorial demonstrates the creation of tickets as an end user.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>Ken is submitting a ticket under the "Business Critical Outage" help topic, as customers are reporting theyâ€™re unable to access mobile banking.</p>

<p>Agents can monitor active tickets in the Agent Panel, while queue managers are responsible for assigning high-priority tickets to the appropriate agents and applying the correct SLA policies.</p>

<p>In this example, we're setting the ticket's priority level to Emergency, as the issue impacts a critical area of the business. We've also updated the SLA plan accordingly and assigned the ticket to a senior technician. Note that in some ticketing systems, customers may have the ability to select their own SLA plans during ticket submission.</p>
